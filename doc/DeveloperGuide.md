AgnosterJ Developer Guide
=========================

This is the Developer Guide for AgnosterJ. This is for people who want to hack on AgnosterJ itself. If youâ€™re a user and want to know how to use AgnosterJ in your shell, see the [User Guide](https://github.com/apjanke/agnosterj-zsh-theme/doc/UserGuide.md) instead.
